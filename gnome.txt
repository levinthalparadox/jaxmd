1. Use neural network to predict energy
2. workflow
    a. start off with existing materials from database
    b. try to make new structures
       a. structural pipeline
          1. create new structure
            a. bias previous models to encourage novel discoveries
            b. have some strategy SAPS
               a. instead of replacing all atoms, can replace some atoms
                  1. ie A2B2X6->instead of substituting both B's, just substitute one B
          2. pass through gnn to predict energy
          3. if energy is low enough, go through dft
       b. chemical pipeline
          1. create new formulas
          2. pass through gnn 
          3. need to create structure too before feeding through dft
             a. AIRSS 
             b. try to create 100 structures
             c. initialize with some basic symmetry products
                1. use softsphere energy (see energy.py)
                2. hard to predict volume(think box size in spaces) 
    d. most promising go through (dft) but also use active learning to improve gnn
3. Network Architecture
    a. see https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/slides/17-geometricDL.pdf
    b. theory
        a. invariant only (ie classification is invariant to rotation, translation, etc)
        b. equivariant(ie segmentation; if you rotate input, expect output to rotate)
        c. key point of graph neural networks is being permutation invariant
    c. prior work
        a. schnet
           1. invariant 
           2. uses relative distance (think scalars no direction)
        b. dimenet
           1. incorporate angles
        c. painn 
           1. also includes equivariant features (think vectors)
    d.  E(3) 
        1. kind of like painn but uses even higher dimensional tensors
